Furry Flip is an animal-themed memory game. Flip the tiles, clear the board, repeat!

This is an app I wanted to build a couple of months into my coding journey but I remember thinking back then that I just did not know how to approach this.
Left it for a bit longer and then with some more experience under my belt realised it was not as hard as I initially thought. The sign of progress, hurray!

After building an MVP I spent some more time to improve the flow of the game, improve the UI, add animations and a screen showing the player's overall stats.
To complete the app I then added sound effects and an end-of-round message to show the stats for the game.

This is one of those apps of mine I look back on fondly.
